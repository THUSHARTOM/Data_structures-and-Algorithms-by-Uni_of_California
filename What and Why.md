# What and Why
- The course primarly follows c++, I decided to complete it in Python.
- Even though the task is difficult I am positive that this will help me understanding the concepts better.

I Decided to do this course primarly because I understood that coding and programming has a lot more to do with problem solving and finding 
efficient ways to implement that solution than simply typing commands. So indepth Knowledge in Data structures and algorithms seemed necessary.
